# Project: Renewable Project Finance Backend (backend-renew)

## Purpose:
This project aims to replace traditional Excel-based financial modeling for renewable energy projects. It will perform debt/equity analysis, 3-way P&L analysis, and enable sensitivity runs.

## Technology Stack:
- **Backend:** Python (current project)
- **Frontend:** Next.js (located in `frontend-renew` folder)
- **Database:** MongoDB (currently configured locally, with plans to integrate result writing)
- **Deployment:** Render (for the backend)

## Current Status & Future Plans:
The backend is set up, but the integration for writing results to the MongoDB database is a future task. The primary goal is to provide a robust, automated system for financial analysis, moving away from manual Excel processes.
